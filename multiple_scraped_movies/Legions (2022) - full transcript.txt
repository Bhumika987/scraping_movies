"The world is full of terrible things and we are defenseless creatures, surrounded by inexplicable and inflexible forces..." Don Juan Matus (Yaqui sorcerer) My name is Antonio Poyju. Some people call me medicaster, shaman, or sorcerer. I prefer to call myself mediatory between worlds. I belong to a lineage of powerful men, my blood is sacred. A while ago, in the Missionary Jungle... - Have you been to Misiones? - No, I've never. Well, in the leafy Missionary Jungle I confronted a demon. A very dangerous demon... from the lowest levels. "Sorcerer, I condemn you and your offspring." I managed to overcome evil a lot of times. But soon I'd have to fight a powerful beast that would take from me what's most precious in my life. That was long, long ago. Thrilling! And horrifying. These beings, coming from the lowest places, are in constant vigil. They go in and out of our world creating chaos, evil. Do you think there are a lot of demons? They're a legion, Olga. Keep telling me afterwards. You will always take my cigarette like this? Without permission? You know you can't smoke Antonio. You smoke, I take it. I thought you'd understand it, after all. HOMICIDE Guilt-free due to Psychopathology Antonio! You look cheerful, I guess it's time to leave that wheelchair. I was told you're part of a recreational activity... theatre? - Something like that. - That's good. It keeps the mind moving, stimulates imagination. Antonio doesn't have no trouble imagining. All right. How are you feeling? I'm surrounded by faithless young people; that makes me sad. Faith, Faith. How's your Faith, Antonio? Listen, Roberto. You're going to stand here, and say your lines, okay? Remember, this is the spot; when he says his lines, you all look at him, OK? You all look at Roberto, then you scream. OK? Even Eduardo. Where is Edu? Edu! There he is! You can't leave wearing your costume. - I told you so. - Do I look scary? You're delaying everything, Eduardo! Go up. This is no way to work, you know? Why don't you come with us? The actors are there, yesterday Carlitos left. - I don't like acting, Olga. - I don't like acting, Olga. I don't like TV, Olga. I don't like anything. A man so powerful that he can't with his sadness. What are you doing here? Roberto has some doubts about the text, and... Ask the Director then! He doesn't get it, Olga. He's a walking contradiction. I'd prefer to ask the author since he's here. When my character says... What does he say, Pedro? "Go, Demon..." "Go, Demon from the four hells", yes! When my character says: "Go, demon of the four hells" Four hells! Four? Shouldn't he say just go to hell? Isn't four a lot? Isn't it too much, Antonio? Do four hells exist, Antonio? What does "blasphemous" mean? Enough! No more delays. We need to hurry! It's important, Olga! We can't act if the lines are not clear. Roberto is right, Tony. Fabian is not respecting your stories. They're not stories but life experiences, Pedro. You two stand here, facing each other. We should tell Fabian. He says they're absurd stories. He's insensitive. He's changing it all! No respect for the play whatsoever. - Get away a bit more. - Fabian! Fabian! The shaman can't look at the creature's eyes, he'd lose his power. No eye contact. Also the creature is from the underworld, so it would have to appear behind him. This would give it logic. Really? What's logic about this, Antonio? The parallel dimension, interdimensional beings, the automata that are watchmen of the devil. Tell me where's the logic, please. See? He doesn't believe in the play. How can he direct it? This is your idea. Why don't you do something else, Fabian? Keep with the adaptation of that classic play. No way! It's totally boring! Are you mad? All the costume is made. We want to do this, your stories are unique, Antonio. Life experiences. The presence that spoke 8 languages, when he drunk with his friends. The woman that saw the ghost on full moon nights. I still can't sleep. The woman didn't see the ghost, she was the ghost. You never got that, Pedro. How? Ten minutes break? Turn off the lights, please. I say we should change the Director, and that's it. Again? He's the third one. No, no. Also there's no more time. We do this, and that's all. Do you want to hear the most important story of my life? Yes, Antonio! We want to hear the most important story of your life. I'm going to tell you about my daughter. - What? Do you have a daughter? - Yes, I do. Elena. Elena Poyju was born on November 6th, 1980. Under a mysterious red moon. Like blood. I met Amanda, my wife, in Puerto Iguazu. She belonged to the Mbya community. We fell crazy in love. Kuaraya. Kuaraya. Don't you want to take our daughter? Don't you want to take our baby? We must protect her Faith. This necklace is unique. It's for her She must carry it all her life. And her Faith will grow with it. We must protect our blood, Antonio. OK, we continue. Lights on, please. Don't listen to him, keep telling us, Tony. Tony, please, you either cooperate or leave. You're distracting everyone. Antonio, you have visitors. It's Warren, your lawyer. - How are you? - Here we are. What that? I hurt myself doing laundry. Tony, don't give up now. We're expecting very good news for next week. You have to be patient, Justice is slow. Any news about my daughter? She's fine. She has a good job. She's somehow fulfilling her dream; growing professionally. So she's happy. She told me she misses you. You don't say. She works all day. It's not easy to survive nowadays. Let's talk about you, and see how we face what's coming. Tony, I'll just ask you to stay out of trouble. No shady situations. Good behavior. So our claim is solid. On the other hand also... "A mysterious red moon took over the sky in most of the world, this Friday... this astrological phenomenon will impact on everyday life... and will have influence on human relationships... Hello? ...some expect a blessed night, others, natural disasters... ancient civilizations used to receive this astrological phenomenon with offerings". Did you get my email? Of course. I saw the slogans, sort of. I didn't have the time. Elena, please don't change anything. We've talked about this. It'd be better if you go alone and do the presentation yourself. You are better at selling ideas. You need to trust yourself! I'm afraid too, but I get over it. Do you think nothing happens to me? This is stress. That's a sty. Grab a key or a ring and leave it outdoors, like in a window. Then get up the next morning, after 8 hours, rub it 3 times for 3 days. Solved. The moon is strong these days, use it. How do you know that? A magazine I read when I was little. Those things... - Are you staying late? - Yes, I need to do this. Help me. It has to be short and clear. Like "for your comfort", or "don't stop looking". But, what is this? It's something to hold toilet paper and a tablet. Or "relax and have fun". Humor sells. I don't know. We're working on a presentation for the client's campaign. I need to get this straight. Well, good luck. - Don't say that! - I'm joking. It'll be okay. You were born for big things, I've always told you that, haven't I? - I love you. - Me too. - Meet me in bed. - OK. "Let nothing stop the call of nature" "Let's go to the next question... who wrote the novel "The three musketeers"?... Albert Camus, Arturo Perez Reverte or Alejandro Dumas?" Alejandro Dumas! Open. Antonio, you've got a visitor. Tell Warren I'm not in the mood. It's a woman. - Easy, easy! - It's me! - My costume! - It's me! - Yes, I know it's you, fucking shit. - The costume! The costume! The costume! I came from very far away to see you, Antonio. Isarrina sent me. I came on her behalf. Isarrina is your grandmother. I see you in dreams, Antonio. I also see Elena, your daughter, in dreams. Elena's in danger, our sacred blood is in danger. Kuaraya wants to sacrifice your daughter, on the red moon's night. Her blood will be an offering for the Evil One. He's trying to be reborn with the power of our lineage. You have to kill Kuaraya. How? Just like you, you have to heal your daughter. Elena must recover her Faith. Elena must see. Life here has its benefits, Tony. They treat you like a baby, they care about you, clean sheets, hot meal. It's a luxury hotel. It's all a matter of perspective; glass half full or half empty. What do you think? I think you adjusted just fine. Do you think they're better outside? I'm not going to drink this tea, do you want it? Yes, dear. Thanks! Cinnamon! Nice touch. You need to be more positive. I'll lend you this book when I finish it. It'll be good for you. "Time to enjoy life" How can you like these movies? Some are based on real events. Go fuck yourself, Pancho. Are you kidding me? I'm going on rounds. OK, hurry up. I need to smoke. Edu, what are you doing? Tony, I want to talk about my character. Can we make it more than growling and evil? Doesn't the demon have other features? I want to lose that stereotype, find a new approach, some details... Go to sleep. Eduardo! What are you doing there? Fucking shit, Eduardo! Antonio! Do you sleep in full makeup? I can't sleep with these thunders. What are you doing here? I need needle and thread. - Needle and thread. - Yes. Will you help me with the costume? No, it's something else, Olga. What? Here! Needle and thread. We can lend you, but under one condition. What do you want? We want to know how the story continues. Right, your daughter! What happened with Elena? Amanda's death broke my heart. Kuaraya took advantage of my weakness. We the inheritors of our lineage have a powerful light. The brightest light creates the biggest shadows Our darkness is as powerful as our light. Kuaraya's power grows from our weaknesses. Elena! Elena! Elena! Elena had inherited a great power, a strong connection with nature. My job as her father was to protect her, her necklace protected her Faith. I protected her life. Kuaraya couldn't take Elena's life. But without her necklace, she would lose her Faith day by day. She would never be the girl she was. She stopped feeling at home in the jungle. Over time, I adjusted my life to hers. We moved into the city. Please turn down the volume when you don't watch TV. Do you prefer the screams and hits? I need to hear them in order to see how they progress. Would you hand me the salt, please? Leave it on the table. Thank you. When are you going to have a normal job? My job is normal, like any other. Do you know how I am doing in school? Good, except for math and physics. I wanted to talk to you about that. Beyond my scores, don't try to change subjects. What's your point? How did you introduce yourself in the parents meeting? I was honest, that's who I am. "My name is Antonio Poyju, some call me medicaster or shaman... I prefer to be called mediatory between worlds, I belong to a lineage of powerful men with sacred blood." And that's right, it's an honor for me. I'm called Legion's kid, Dad. Boys avoid me like I have a plague. Some parents took their kids out of school after your sincere introduction. It's a miracle I'm still there. People are afraid of the unknown, it's just ignorance. That's not our fault. Why do you think I didn't want to celebrate my 15th birthday? Didn't it seem weird? I don't know, you're so quiet sometimes. No one was going to come, Dad! It was going to be a failure. Your life is ruining mine, Dad. Don't talk like that, Elena. You have to be proud of what we are. We... I'm Elena, I'm 17 years old, I live in Villa Crespo... I like Bon Jovi, Duran Duran, soap operas, videogames and Ricky Martin. I want that to be my introduction, do you get it, Dad? I need my life to be normal, so far nothing was. What's normal for you? Not this. This house isn't normal. A lady calling you at 3 AM because ghosts stole her jewelry is not normal. Some ghosts hold on to material things, so what? Is it normal to smell like sulfur and have green vomit in your clothes? This is part of the healing, don't pay attention to it. Elena, please don't touch that. It's dangerous! How I'm supposed to not pay attention to this? Don't open that door! Is this normal to you? Don't get closer, he can bite. Is this guy normal to you? I don't want to live like this anymore, Dad. No! Did he hurt you? Are you okay? Is he dead? No, baby, no. He's not dead. No. He's not. You have to help me escape. - Escape? - Yes, tonight. Listen to me. Olga, fucking shit. Always so stealthy. Tony, I got some flashlights. What are you doing in those clothes? It's for the ritual. "For the sacred blood, for your daughter" Lower your voice. - "Aconcagua" - We're in sync! May I come in to watch TV? Why not in the dining room? It broke, again. You can't be here, Olga. You'll get me in trouble. Do I make you nervous? You don't... Let me hear the questions. What about a massage? We're about to witness real voodoo magic. Take it easy, they'll hear us. I'm scared, but I love it. I love this, so much. "How does this phrase continue? Loose lips..." Sink ships! If you're going to answer them all, you're gone. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Silence, please. I'm going to work with powerful things. I need care and respect. Make room. A little more. - Are you taking notes? - Yes. What's that? A gift for your daughter? It's me! It's me, you guys! "Sacred vehicle... I trust you to recognize this personal belonging" "Sacred smoke. Powerful connector. Give me energy" Did you picture this? I expected something else. Let's go see check outside. Yeah, let's go. What the fuck? Eye pressure, coffee maybe. Let me see. Let me see the eye! Can I play for a bit? Careful, turn off the flashlight. What are you doing? It burns! It burns! I'm burning! Initially, you're going to sleep in this hotel. Is it OK for you? Absolutely. I found out where your daughter works. The plan is that you meet with her personally. You'll have to make an appointment. Make an appointment... I need sacred tools to work on Elena, what did you bring me? You'll need to look like the father she wants in order for her to listen to you. I need to dress up. Dress up to fight the demon. Wise shaman knows how to hide, he must earn her trust. No magic. To stay in touch. This is the password. How can I convince her if she fears me? Trusting in her inner wisdom. Your words can heal her. "Technical service, press 1. Suppliers, press 2... Customer support, press 3. One minute please. One minute please" You can take the elevator, straight to the second floor. - Thank you very much. - No problem. - Good morning. - Hello, good morning. I'm looking for Miss Elena Poyju. Poyju. Poyju. There's no one here under that last name. There must be a mistake. Elena Poyju. Yes, but no Sir. There's no one with that last name in our database. Look, she's my daughter. I'm looking for her. This is her. Maybe with a present picture I could recognize her. I'm sorry. - I need to keep doing my job. - Of course. Hello, good morning. Miss, Warren. Look her up. Elena Warren. - Yes? - Mrs. Warren, there's someone who wants to see you. Who is it? Your name, please? Antonio Poyju, her father. Unfortunately Mrs. Warren can't see you this week. Call her next week. Hello. My father is here, at my office. Miss Poyju? Warren! I'm Warren. I'm Mrs. Warren. I'm sorry, Mrs. Warren. Is your father there? Yes, that's what I said. He's here. Please come quickly. I'm sending professionals right now. Take him, be nice. If he gets violent... "Meditation 1... with your eyes slightly closed, take several deep breaths" - Did you hear? - What are we going to do? First, you need to calm down, they're going to find him. No, he came to the firm looking for me! But did you see him? Did you talk to him? No, I don't want to. I ordered not to let him in and called the clinic too. I get you. It's an awful situation. And after all, he's your Dad. But you were right not to let him in. How would you? He can be dangerous. He could have hurt you, no kidding. I can't imagine what crossed his mind to make that decision. This will have legal consequences. "Any news about my father?" Aren't you gonna ask how we did? Yes, sorry. How was it? It was great. The clients got a good impression, they liked the ideas. Your ideas. "Let nothing stop the call of nature" They found it great, the idea, the phrase, the concept, everything. - Really? - Really. And look, I did what you said. It's better. Go figure! Warren, the little witch. "No, not at all" "Meditation 1... with your eyes slightly closed, take several deep breaths... get rid of all tension in your body... imagine... feel the touch of the energy that surrounds you... every breath helps you get lower and lower... till a beautiful relaxation mood... now we open our eyes, relax the face and jaw muscles... release all the tension" Hello daughter. How did you get in? Baby... I need you to stay calm... and hear me carefully. We don't have time. You will hear me carefully. You're going back to that institution.... you can't just walk around the streets. There's nothing wrong with me, Elena. I need you to listen to me. You won't be able to reach anyone as long as I'm here. Where's everyone? Security! Security! Please, where is everyone? Elena! Kuaraya is after you. - Stay away. - I need you to wake up. Again with this nonsense, Dad? You're living someone else's dream, baby. There's nothing here from your world. Nothing. No goals fit you. You have to heal, Elena, - in order to find your voice again. - No! This is who I am, Dad! You never accepted my decisions. Go away, don't get near me. Those are alien thoughts, darling. Kuaraya drove you crazy, but your blood and roots are sacred. Go away, I don't want to hear you. No, no. You'll make me crazy. This is for your protection. Enough! Don't talk to me! That beast has a sharp smell. I need to be quiet. Go away! He won't find you with this. Stop it, please. Stop it, please. What about the original plan? What happened to my intimacy? I didn't mean to scare you. The original plan didn't work. We need to face Kuaraya's power with more powerful weapons. He feeds on Elena's lack of Faith. What will you do? First, we need to light up my daughter's eyes. If she recovers her Faith, Kuaraya's power will decrease. Then we can kill her. Crossing his heart, like any beast. We have a allies. Hariri Sarina, an expert in healing beverages. Igua, keeps blessing. Acts as a defense. Protector ally Angue. Very powerful. Sacred vehicle, I trust you will receive this personal object and give me power. Are you awake, love? Is it crazy to think I'm special? Not at all. You were born to do big things. Sleep. Rest. The world needs kind souls. Soldiers that feed the darkness devouring the planet. Your daughter belongs to me. What did you do with Marcelo Warren? Out, incarnation of evil! Come here! Come! We need to take all this. I had the weirdest dream. I dreamed of my mother, Amanda. Have I ever told you her name? No. I've never dreamed of her, I never met her. But it was her. Maybe you could rest today, couldn't you? You've been through so much because of your father. At least one day you could use some sleep. - Do you think so? - I do. - Drink it before it's cold. - Thank you. They say tonight is going to be very special. Red moon night. Will we stare at it together? That's just what I was thinking! We should stare at the red moon together. What happened to your face? Tony, Tony, can you hear us? What happened to your daughter, Antonio? Could you kill Kuara... Kuara... How was it, Pedro? It doesn't matter. Tony... We need to know what happened with the shadow. We made changes in the play, now Elena is in it... Yes, your daughter. So we need to know how it ended, because we don't have an ending. Dory is coming to watch the rehearsal, and we don't have an ending. We need you to tell us, Tony... Tony... I don't think he can hear you. They've drugged him. Tony... Tony! Automaton... be my eyes... hands... and voice. To be abandoned by a loved one. Having a lonely death. If it makes you feel better, death is lonely for everyone. Even for the most powerful. Kuaraya's lookout... how didn't I notice? So many self help books. She's here. Thank you for coming to the dress rehearsal. This year we got out of classics and, with the institution's permission... we decided to do this play, based on the fantastic stories... of Antonio Poyju... Me! Me! And with Pedro Rivas collaboration. Yes! I'm a writer. I can't breathe in this! So, without further due, I hope you enjoy it. Thank you. Lights, please. Good, you were great. My name is Antonio Poyju... Some call me shaman, some other call me... I prefer to call myself mediatory between worlds. - Why are they laughing? - Shut up. But it wasn't. I come from a drainage of sacred beings. Drainage? It's lineage! And my blood is powerful. He doesn't know the words, how is he going to act, Fabian? We need a different actor. Come on, little girl. Don't be afraid of me. The scream has to be heartbreaking. If you die trying, then die. What? Now? - Hey, be careful. - Yes, yes. Blasphemer from hell. Get out of this innocent body. Let her go! Let her go! It must be heartbreaking give it all. I'm the director. Shut up. I'm the director. OK? Shut up then. Come here! Let her go, devil demon! Let her go! It's your turn. And now the scream. Hi, I'm here to see a patient. Visiting hours end at 7 PM. What's happening? Stay! Stay! DEVIL'S THING. The terrace. Clara! Clara! No, Dad! That's Kuaraya. I'm Elena Poyju, daughter of Antonio Poyju. And, as my dad, I too belong to a millenary lineage. Our blood is sacred.
