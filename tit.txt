Come on.I got you, homie.Almost there.What happened?Where are we?We crashed.That's all we know right now.Something about a storm.I'm gonnaget you some drink of water.Yeah, I'll go get some.Anyone have directionsto the nearest bodega?First one that winsgets whatever we find to eat.Yeah.Card up.-King-I like it.Two kings.How you doing?How you holding up?Pretty good. How about you?Mm. A little tired.You got a nasty wound here, pal.Oh, yeah.Well, if you keep picking at it,it will never get better.That is a sick wound.Would make for onehell of an album cover.I'm in the industry.Name is Midnight.Baphomet Records.Great. Are you going to help?Oh, yeah, absolutely.We want to surviveas long as we possibly can.I thought you people love death.Well, yes, it's true.We do acknowledge death,but who doesn't, really?We just realizethat death isa part of existence.I want to get as fardown that track as possible.Great story and all,but I still got this issue,the glass in my arm.Right, so...count of three, shall we?-One.-One, two,three.Oh, uh, Amber, look at me.Look at me, please.She'll need to put a shirt on.We've only beenhere a couple hours.It's gonna geta hell of a lot hotter,before it starts easing off.Don't you thinkit's a little late for that?You want to go for a walk?Check out the rest of the beach?Let's go, let's go.- Yeah.- Hey.Get your ass back to work.That looks painful.Definitely.- Hey.- Yeah.Hey, I'm doing it.-It's not good.-Nope.Did you find any of the others?No one else.Everyone who survivedmust have washed up here.How many peoplewere on that plane?-Hundreds.-Look how many survived.Look.We're not out of the woods yet.And I fear our numbersmay drop further.But we need Amber. Huh?We will light a candlefor those who have passed,when we getback to civilization.-All right?-Okay.I saw some horses.Well, now.I'm going to play cowboy,I'm going to need my hat.- Hey, a boat.- Yeah.Maybe we can get out of here.Let's check it out.Maybe we can fix it.Well, I'm going to gosee if I can find any supplies.Sure.Yeah, I don't thinkwe can fix this.Mags?Mags?Mags?Mags, where are you?What is that?Maggie?- Yeah.- Mags, what the fuck?- Careful!- Oh, my God.- Sorry.- Let's go this way.Oh, my God. Dude.What were youlooking for down there?- For you.- Why would I be down there?Get off of me, get off me.Damn seagulls. Get away from me!I-- I-- I was justhaving a, um---Having a nightmare?-Yeah, uh--What happened to us?If we had crashedanywhere near town,there would bepeople coming out here now.Looks like we're on our own.We're going tostart surviving, okay?I really want to help,but I just don't know how.When do we get to eat?If I had some food,I'd give it to you,but it looks like we'reall under the same circumstancesNow, what we needthe most is water.-Where did you get that?-Right out there.From the ocean?Dude, do not,under any circumstances,drink ocean water, come on.We can walk around the island,try to find a river.You know, in a pinch...you can drink your own urine.Ew.I mean, it doesn't taste great,but it gets the job done.We just need to build something.Like what?Maybe we can buildsomething off the ground.Protect us from enemies.We need to find a clear space.It's a lot easierthan clearing it ourselves.Then, we builda barrier around us.A man with a plan.I like it. Let's do it.All right, ladies and gentlemen.we don't know how longwe're going to be out hereon this island.Our first priority right nowneeds to be to build a shelter.We need food.That should beour first priority.There's no point in eatingif our bodies are justgoing to be left out here to diein this environment.There's no pointin having shelterif we're just lying there,starving to death.This is survival.No one gives a shitabout your opinion.Oh, girls,put your claws away.I'd say you're both right.There's no reasonwhy we can't do both plans.We have enough people here.Fine.Two groups.You go find your food.We can build a shelter.-Does that work for you?-Oh, tip-top. Vicky.Maybe we can build a raftand try to getthe hell out of here.You gonna lend me your axe?How about enough of your sarcasmand you do something important?Listen, even if we built one,we still don'tknow which way to go.All right, so what is the plan?Whatever it is,we should get started.What are we looking for?I don't know, just...anything that canbe considered food.Careful where you step.Could be snakes.If we step on oneand it doesn't bite us,we could always kill it.Snakes?Keeps getting better and better.Don't worry about it, man.I had a friendthat collected snakes.He said you cantell the poisonous onesby the markings.But then again,when you get close enoughto look at them,you're in the danger zone.I hate snakes.Ow! Damn it.Amber Renée Sterling.What have I toldyou about cursing?'Atta girl. Keep it up.We're going to needthat to stay warm.-Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait.-What?-Do you know what that is?-No.All right, listen up, everybody.If you find something to eatand you don't know what it is,just don't eat it, okay?There's plenty of stuffout here that can kill us.So, how do we know ifanything's safe to eat here?How are we supposed to test it?Just try it, I guess.If you're okay, tomorrowwe can come back for more.Well, we could draw lotsand loser has to eat shit.Or, maybe, we could vote on itand the loserhas to eat everything.Well, then,you're probably screwed.Calm down. Calm down.Let's just, you know, relax.Calm down.Well, you'reour fearless leader.So why aren't you outthere volunteering, hm?I mean, what exactlyis the grand plan?Is it just to stay hereand slowly starveand then go pick shitoff of the bushes willy-nilly?Look, I only knowso much about survival,and most of that isthe shit I've seen on TV.I don't think Vic,or any of us for that matter,knows too much more.Guys, let's split into pairs.Stay close to your buddy,and if you find something,say something.And who put you in charge?Do you have a better plan?All right, guys.Just relax, okay?I think it's a great plan.All right.I'll take as my partner,uh-- uh, what's your name again?Akira.Yes, my good,faithful companion.Akira and I willhead over this wayand, uh, see what we can find.Shall we sally forth? Yes.Let's go.Hey, uh, do you know Amber?She says she sawwild horses on this island,so maybe we can captureone of them and eat it.Oh, do you haveany home recipes for horse?Why would I?I am joking, darling.I'm joking.I-- it's just that onceI was in the Alps on tour,and I had an exquisite,Hirschenrouladenin a Bavarian farm village. Oh!Now, the Germans,they sort of frown uponthat sort of thing,but if you have enough of this,they'll let you get away with,you know a little--Uh, let's see.Let's see if wecan find some more nuts.I mean,I already got two myself,- but, you know--- nuts.Hey, you got three.You're doing well, man.More than me.Let's see if there'sanything higher up.Maybe we'll be luckyto find one of those lizards.- Is that a crab?- Huh?-Hey, check this out.-Oh, that's cool.Let me try to get it.-Okay.-Okay.Careful.I think we can eat this.Grab it.Akira,look what I found! Shit.What do we have here?Here, horsey, horsey, horsey.Come to Midnight.So, you think there's any fish,or anythingwe can catch in there?Maybe piranhas?No, no, no, no, no.There could be alligators.They like to lay and wait.Maybe we should split up.We'll covermore ground that way.Okay. I'll go this way.Wow.What is this place?Hello?Akira.No, no, no.-Is that Dawkins?-I think so.Hey, Dawkins?Dawkins!What the---Damon.-Wait, hold on.I think there'ssomething out there.Is that an arm?Oh, oh, oh!Y'all should run.Just-- Come on!What the fuck?It's gonna take more than youto fucking take me down.Was that...Dawkins's arm?I think so.All right.So, who are you people,and what are you doing here?Where the helldid you come from?Say, if I hadn'tjust stepped in now,every single oneof you would be dead,so I'd appreciate it,if you would answer my goddamnquestions when I ask them.We were flying toPuerto Rico, when our--our plane went down and...-we wound up here.-Shit.I think now I'd give uphoping for a rescue party.I'm sorry, man, but, uh...we're not a rescue party.Didn't you see thatplane that went down?No, I, uh...I keep to myself.Well, we're all that's leftof a full aircraft.Probably going tobe a lot more bodieswashing up soon.We were hoping supplieswould wash up as well.Yeah, well,you'd be better off fishing...during the day.We suddenlyjust figured that out.How many moreof those things are out there?There's enough.- Oh, shit! Come on.- Come on. Come on.Oh, shit!Look out! Over there!I got one!Let's see what you have!You have anything fire?Mommy, he ate me.Wait. Hold up.- Over there.- Look out.Keep firing. Keep firing.Run!Come on.Let go! I got you!Oh, shit. I go high, you go low.You already know.It's scared of us, look!Me and my brotherkicked your ass.Shit!This doesn'tlook too good, bro.Oh, shit.They don't like burning.Stay back, stay back.Where'd you come from?Those damn things justtook out half our group.Yeah.Yeah, they'll do that.But didn't takehalf your people.Not yet.Not friends of yours, are they?No.Killed my whole teamon the very first daywe were here.-So this is your fault.-My fault?You're the one thattook some of the group off- and got five of them killed.- Look, we don't needany more fighting tonight,all right?Man, to hell with this.Any of you guyswant to come with me,you can get up and come on.Or you can stay with himand wind up dead.It's not a good ideato split up the party.Did I ask you?-No.-Good.Come on, guys.I'm with you, boss.I'm with you. Vic.Wait. What?He's with the FBI.Seems like he knowswhat he's doing.As long as he doesn't have usrunning aroundlike headless chickens,I'm gonna follow him, girl.-Wait, you can't be serious.-Wait!Are you leaving us?Mags?I just don't wannasee anyone else die.Hey! We came here together,we're gettingout of here together.It's just-- It's not safe.I have to.Where the hell are you going?Chance of survival seemsto be better with the FBI agent.I know we don't.-Good luck to you.-Thanks, man.-I'm rolling with them.-No. No.What?Trust me.Well, fuck.-Good morning.-Hey.So, tell me...how much do youreally know about survival?Um...Not much, really.All right, everybody, up.Come on, up.So, I assume you all have...limited knowledge and experiencesurviving in the wild.Well, I'm willing to teach youif you're willing to learn.We have limited daylight hours.It starts to get dim,those things get bolder.We have a lot to doin a little timeif you all want tomake it through the night.So, we shouldprobably start with torches.These things fear fire.Torches are priority number one.You always wantto have a couple on hand,in case it goes out.So, the sea isfruitful and generous.She is also loaded with sharks.So, we try to keep thisin the shallows.So the idea iswe create an inland.Tide moves in, traps the fishes,-it moves out.-How long does that take?Check back later today.Tomorrow morning at the latest.And I think it's bestwe keep theseburning at all times.So make extra.What we're going to be doingis making fish traps.Pretty simple concept.What we're gonna do iswe're going totake these rocks...We're going to put them aroundjust like this.Until we have onesmall opening for a high tideso the fish cancome and swim in.Once the water goes downand low tide comes...we'll have fish.Greatest dangerduring the day is the sun,so we need to buildsome kind of shelter.Good. Good. There.You can build itas big as you like,but usually the smaller it is,the more stable.Good. It's good.Got it. Good.All right, well...let's get these torches up.This guy is a godsend.You're right about that.We're so lucky.Hey.Come with me.-Come on.-Okay.Isn't it beautiful?I found it when I waslooking for supplies earlier.You're beautiful.You guys having fun out there?I just figured ifyou guys were done,maybe I could, uh, take over.There's not a chance.Why don't you beat it?Now, that's not nice.You want to learn howto survive on this island,you need to learn how to share.Is that all you got?Where do you think you're going?You fully have no idea.Get up, pretty boy.Come on.Oh, shit.Where the hell am I?Fucking bitch.I'm so sorry.It's not my fault.Is this what you want?Is this what you want?Did you kill my baby?Did you kill my Amber?Come on.Let's see what you could dowhen someone'sactually facing you.You're not so tough now,are you?Maybe we could try again.I'm sure there are plentyof other waterfalls around.Where'd you two sneak off to?It's all right. Hey.Y'all come with me.I'd like to show you something.Where are you taking us?Home.Got a lot of rainwaterif you're thirsty.Hell, I even havea little rum if it suits you.So, um...what's your story, Bruce?I was out running maneuverswith my crewand out of nowhere,our tech went haywireand we went down.We were inthe water for three daysbefore we washed upon the island.They all got picked offon the first night.Then, I was alone.It must have been hard on you.Yeah. At first.Time is a funny thing, you know.I put marks in trees at firstto count the days.Forget a few times,then why bother?After that, all the daysjust run together.The nights,they just bleed in, bleed out,bleed in, bleed out.You lose track.After I figured outthe creaturesare afraid of fire,survival wasn't too difficult.I just wanted tokeep an extra torch lit.Oh, but Christ,I do miss the world.Anybody back home?Yeah.Sure do.My wife, Sally. My boy, Steven.They're beautiful.Bruce, uh...which war were you in?What do you mean, which war?The war.The Great War.What?Oh, your accident.What was the date?September 19th.Uh, no, the year.1917.What?Our accident, Bruce.May 16th, 2022.The War ended,like, 100 years ago.-He's right.-You're fucking with me.No, I'm not.Well, it doesn'tmake sense, it's...Here.Take a look.It's my driver's license.-Here.-Oh.I was born in 1992.I don't understand.I don't-- I don't--That would mean my wife...-my boy.-I'm sorry.Did we win?What?The war.Did we win?Yeah.We won.Good.That's good.Why don't you allhead back to the beach?And I'll, uh...catch up with you later.Bruce.All right. Come on.I think I know a way, okay?Let's give him some time.-Damon?-Yeah.I don't thinkwe're gonna see Brucefor a few days.Yeah, I know.Could you imaginebeing told that?Not in a million years.How is he still so young?How is he over 100 years old?Honestly,none of this makes sense.The triangle.It's real.Real as in?The disappearance of boats,ships and planes.They enter the Bermuda Triangleand then boom, they're gone.They just vanishinto nothingness.Maybe this is where they end up.And what sciencemakes sense for that?I don't know.I mean, maybe it's, uh...reality warping or...another dimension.I-- I have no clue.Yeah, well,how do we get out of here?You don't.Apparently,I have been stuck herefor over 100 years.It's just likeone big, goddamn circle.Well, the way I see it,if we found a way in,we can find a way out.Yeah.But first, we gotta survive.Wake up!- I'm okay.- Stay with us.It's gonna be okay.Hey. How is she?I don't know, Damon.I'm not a fucking doctor.-I'm sorry.-It's okay.I don't know ifshe's going to make it.Her injuries might betoo severe to save her.I understand but...right now,I'm trying to save all of us.Come on. We have a plan.Can't you tell me here?We shouldn't leave her.It won't take long, I promise.Okay.You really thinkthis is a good idea?It's the best one we've got.I can teach youwhat you need to know.But this is do or die.All right?There's no contingency.There's no fallback option.There's no cavalry.It's us and them.Yeah, dozens and dozens of them.Maybe hundreds?- No.I've beenaround them long enoughto get a general head count.They're a tribal species.Pack hunters like wolves.But I'll warn you...there is an alpha.A pack leader, and he willbe the hardest to kill by far.But total?Maybe two dozen.Maybe.There's a few weaponsyou'll have toget comfortable with.Spear, bow and arrow.A spear can be thrown,but works great forclose-quarters combat.It's the monsters,you got to get close,'cause they've got teethand they've got claws.And the spearwill help keep that distance.Let's go through it again.You have got to be kidding me.Wrong.close-quarters combat.Oh.It's uh...it's two fingers.Oh, hell yeah, Carolyn.That was awesome.I threw javelin in college.I gotta check on Dakota.Okay.So, I'm thinking next, we'llwork on forging some weapons.There's plentyof materials out hereon this island we can useto put some together.Bows and arrows, spears.We can even usethem for hunting.And what about for silencingoverpromising assholes?I'm sorry, what was that?Oh, our great leader,the honorable FBI agent,he's a con.He's been lyingto us the whole time.If it hadn't beenfor him following Damonand the rest of the group,we'd probably be dead by now.-What's she talking about?-Man, look at her.- She's confused.- No.Every single thingyou have done,you stole from that vetin the other group.Is that true, Vic?What does it matterwhere I got it from?Because thatwas the whole point.You were supposed tobe this superior leader.Your knowledgeand expertise were supposedto save usand get us off this island.I'm a liar.You're alive, aren't you?You could have left.I never told youI was a survivalist.I never said follow me.That's just your own damn fault.You assumed.-Hey, captain.-Yeah?Mutiny.Mutiny.For your crimesof lying, misleading.Oh, my God. Oh, my God.What were you saying?We never shouldhave trusted you,you piece of shit.What is he doing?What was that about a mutiny?I said I would do anythingto get us all out of this alive.I guess that waseverybody but you.It's my fault.How?I forgot to makesure the torch was lit.I mean, it's an honest mistake.You don't getthe big picture, do you?-We've got a plan---Do you really want tospend the rest of your life hereworrying abouthaving a fire lit?And what happensif the oil runs out?You're puttinga whole lot of faithin this plan of his.And what if it doesn't work out?Then what?Then we die.This is it.Either we kill them all...or we die.God, I'm such an idiot.Almost there.Ah, Jesus.Jimmy, I'm gettingreally tired--I hope you get food poisoning.The monsters holed up here.This is all open beach,so they won't haveanywhere to go but the ocean.They're not as afraidof that as they are of the fire.We have a presetbooby trap waiting for themwith the oil encircling them.Once we get them in there,we just need someone to come upthe back where they came in,close off the circle.After that, it's prettymuch just target practice.So, how do we head theminto the trap space?We're going to need bait.What kind of--Oh, my God.- You son of a bitch.- Hey. Whoa, whoa, whoa.Go ahead, sweetheart.Just give me a reason.Where's Frank?- No.- Both of them traitors.Frank...and this little bitch.Fuck you.What the fuck?All right. All right.What do you want?I favored your plan.Sounds good.And you mentionedsomething about bait?Someone's gonna have to lead himinto the center of the circle.Problem with that is that, uh--Flames on one side...creatures on the other.- Exactly.- I'll do it.Jimmy, no.Damon, let me do this.So touching.So....What's your plan on how we'regonna get off this island?First,we need to set up the oil trapfrom the outside.Except the entrance, right?That's right.Somebody's gonnahave to come in from behindjust to finish it off.-They're gonna have to be fast.-How fast?Fast enough to get itclosed off,but not so fast youcatch yourself on fire.I'll do it.I used to run track in college.- I can handle it.- All right.I give you the signal,you close it off.Gonna have to be quick, though,cause those fuckers are fastwhen they wanna be.You'll have seconds at best.You have to make sureyou get them all in the circle.All right? Blood, loud noises,draw them out.No fire anywhere near you.Then Damon comes along...closes off the circle.After that, we pick them off,let them burn themselves up.We have to make surewe keep that fire going.What if something goes wrong?Well, then we'll deal with it.Over here!Go!Jimmy!Are you insane?Where my plan startsto differ from yours.You need to think about this.Hey, I knew we couldn'ttrust you!-Mike!-Go!I can't.Go.What are you?This is my island.It looks like Paradise......but we're asfar away from it as you can get.And I...I am the closest thingto the Devil thatyou will find here.Shit.Eat well.Who knows whenthe next group is coming?
